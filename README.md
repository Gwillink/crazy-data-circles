The code examples are for the “Crazy Data Circles” workshop, an introduction to the fundamentals of [d3.js](http://d3js.org), led by Scott Murray.  So far, the workshop has been offered on:

- June 5, 2013 at the [Eyeo Festival](http://eyeofestival.com/) in Minneapolis
- June 13, 2013 at [ITP Camp](http://itp.nyu.edu/camp2013/) in New York
- October 21, 2013 at [HTML5 Developer Conference](http://html5devconf.com/training.html#murray_d3js) in San Francisco (with Jerome Cukier)

Some of these examples are adapted from the sample code files for *Interactive Data Visualization for the Web* (O’Reilly, March 2013).
